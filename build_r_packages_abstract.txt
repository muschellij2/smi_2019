The jump from R programming with scripts to packages can be quite large.  We hope to answer some of the basic questions of getting you started with package development answering the questions of:  How do you create a basic R package?  What are some R package best practices?  How do I know if I can install this package?  How do I depend on other packages?  The tutorial will go through a simple 2-function package and describe resources to use after the course, including the R Package Development YouTube series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79s3z0gIuFU&list=PLk3B5c8iCV-T4LM0mwEyWIunIunLyEjqM&index=1
